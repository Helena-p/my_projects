        The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they
        remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when
        multi-cellular organisms began to appear.

            Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally
            microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include
            Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.

          These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where
          there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior. Their
          reproduction is both rapid and profuse. The combination of a high
          mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer They form an essential part
          of the planetary ecosystem. However, some microorganisms are pathogenic
          and can post health risk to other organisms.

        Another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds.
        Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way
        to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to
        describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is
        illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to
        alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often
        categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests,
        etc. according to their relationship to human life.
